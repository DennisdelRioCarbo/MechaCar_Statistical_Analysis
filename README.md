- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The only two variables that provide a non-random amount of variance in the dataset are *vehicle_length* and *ground_clearance*.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
From our linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (mpg) is explained using this linear model.
